Disks fail all the time. Servers overheat. Network connections get flaky. You assume that you are prepared for such a scenario, because you have replicated your servers. You have the database backed up. Your core application is spread across multiple availability zones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But are you really sure that your system is resilient? The only way to prove that your system is resilient to failure is to experience failure, and to make swift responsiveness to failure an integral part of your software.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaos engineering is the practice of routinely testing your system’s resilience by inducing controlled failures. Netflix was the first company to discuss chaos engineering widely, but more and more companies are starting to work it into their systems, and finding it tremendously useful. By inducing failures in your system, you can discover unknown dependencies, single points of failure, and problematic state conditions that can cause data corruption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kolton Andrus worked on chaos engineering at Netflix and Amazon, where he designed systems that would test system resiliency through routine failures. Since then, he founded Gremlin, a company that provides chaos engineering as a service. In a previous episode, Kolton and I discussed why chaos engineering is useful, and he told some awesome war stories about working at Amazon and Netflix. In this show, we explore how to build a chaos engineering service&#8211;which involves standing up Gremlin containers that institute controlled failures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the previous episode I recorded with Kolton, as well as other supplementary materials described in this show, download the Software Engineering Daily app for </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iOS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

These technologies have only been widely talked about for the last 5-10 years. That means that they are easy to adopt for startups that get founded in the last 5-10 years, but not necessarily for older enterprises.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within a large enterprise, it can be challenging to make significant changes to how technology is used. Many of the listeners might even take it for granted that your source code is in git&#8211;but if you work at an enterprise that started building software in 1981, you might be moving source code around on FTP servers or floppy disks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difficulty of changing the technology within an enterprise gets compounded by culture. Culture develops around specific technologies. That is one interpretation of “Conway’s Law”&#8211;that the way an organization uses software informs an organization’s communication structure. This is no surprise&#8211;if your organization manages code using FTP servers and floppy disks, it will slow down your innovation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zhamak Dehghani is an engineer at ThoughtWorks, where she consults with enterprises to modernize their software and culture. She works off of a blueprint that describes specific steps that an enterprise can take towards modernizing: continuous integration; building a data pipeline; building a system of experimentation. In some ways, this conversation fits nicely with our shows about DevOps a few years ago.
